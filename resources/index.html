				<ul>
					<li>The Scientist Action and Advocacy Network is a New York-based group of scientists who provide <i>pro bono</i> research and data visualizations for partnering organizations. We've collaborated in the past with the Raise the Age NY campaign, the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance, and BagIt! NYC. Example projects: We launched a multimedia legislative campaigns to raise support for a 5-cent plastic bag fee in NYC. We provided a neuroscience research brief to legislators in Albany to support legislation to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 16 to 18 years of age (note: I am a prison abolitionist).</li>
					<li>Science for the People is a magazine founded in 1969 out of the anti-war movement. It published until 1989 and was revived in 2015. The movement promotes a radical analysis of science through a decentralized and non-hierarchical governing structure.</li>
