			<h1>resources &amp; recommendations</h1>
			<p>Here are some resources for which I'm grateful.</p>
    		<div class="blurb">
        		<h2>science &amp; activism</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The Scientist Action and Advocacy Network is a New York-based group of scientists who provide <i>pro bono</i> research and data visualizations for partnering organizations. E.g., in 2017, we provided a neuroscience research brief to legislators in Albany in support of raising the age of criminal responsibility from 16 to 18 years of age in New York state (note: I am a prison abolitionist). We always welcome new members.</li>
					<li>Science for the People is a magazine founded in 1969 out of the anti-war movement. It published until 1989 and was revived in 2015. The movement promotes a radical analysis of science through a decentralized and non-hierarchical governing structure. It is easy to volunteer with the publication and help support the movement.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>neuroethics</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>A repository of neuroethics readings and syllabi, appropriate for interested neuroscientists with little non-scientific training. I've scraped this together from previous neuroethics course syllabi and owe the lists to the fantastic instructors who compiled them. (Work in progress)</li>
					<li>The medical price list for all billable procedures at NYU Langone. NYU Langone was Cambridge Analytica's largest corporate client, and its boardmembers actively fund opposition to medicare for all.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>favourite books</h2>
				<p>Here are some wide-ranging, general-audience books that have affected me immensely:
				<ul>
					<li>Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer (non-fiction)</li>
					<li>New Dark Age by James Bridle (non-fiction)</li>
					<li>Island by Aldous Huxley (fiction)</li>
					<li>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig (fiction)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>More on goodreads.</p>
				<h2>grad student empowerment</h2>
				<p>STEM graduate students are often overlooked as vulnerable actors. They occupy a precarious space in the academic landscape. They assume many of the responsibilities of employed workers but receive few of the protections that one would expect of a typical employer-employee relationship. Importantly, they tend to have little to no recourse in cases of abuse. They are often under immense pressure from their employers to produce unrealistic scientific results which exacerbates problems related to scientific integrity (and animal ethics) among experimentalists.  Foreign visa-holding students face additional uncertainties and challenges which make them even more vulnerable to exploitation. While NYU is one of the first private universities to have recognized its graduate student worker's union, STEM PhD students are specifically, contractually excluded from this bargaining unit.
				<ul>
					<li>GSOC-UAW (The Union for Graduate Employees at new York University)</li>
					<li>My graduate advisor, Wei Ji Ma, has a "lab life" and "lab culture" page, which are, I think, great resources for academics at all stages. The lab has also done much to promote a healthy, positive, and collaborative environment in the neuroscience department at NYU.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/events/growingupinscience/">Growing Up in Science</a>: A speaker series in which STEM faculty members "share their life story, with a focus on struggles, failures, doubts, detours, and weaknesses." Started by my graduate advisor, Wei Ji Ma, it is now a worldwide network. An excellent antidote to imposter syndrome.</li>
				</ul>
