				<ul>
					<li>The Scientist Action and Advocacy Network is a New York-based group of scientists who provide <i>pro bono</i> research and data visualizations for partnering organizations. E.g., in 2017, we provided a neuroscience research brief to legislators in Albany in support of raising the age of criminal responsibility from 16 to 18 years of age (note: I am a prison abolitionist). We always welcome new members.</li>
					<li>Science for the People is a magazine founded in 1969 out of the anti-war movement. It published until 1989 and was revived in 2015. The movement promotes a radical analysis of science through a decentralized and non-hierarchical governing structure.</li>
