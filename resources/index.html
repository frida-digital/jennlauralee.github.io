			<h1>resources &amp; recommendations</h1>
			<p>Here are some resources for which I'm grateful.</p>
    		<div class="blurb">
        		<h2>science &amp; activism</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>The <a href = "scaan.net">Scientist Action and Advocacy Network</a> is a New York-based group of scientists who provide <i>pro bono</i> research and data visualizations for partnering organizations. E.g., in 2017, we provided a neuroscience research brief to legislators in Albany in support of raising the age of criminal responsibility from 16 to 18 years of age in New York state. We always welcome new members.</li>
					<li><a href = "https://scienceforthepeople.org/">Science for the People</a> is a magazine founded in 1969 out of the anti-war movement. It published until 1989 and was revived in 2015. The movement promotes a radical analysis of science through a decentralized and non-hierarchical governing structure. It is easy to volunteer with the publication and help support the movement.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>ai ethics</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>A non-exhaustive list of <a href = "https://becominghuman.ai/100-brilliant-women-in-ai-ethics-to-follow-in-2019-and-beyond-92f467aa6232">100 women in AI ethics</a> to follow, compiled by Mia Dand.</li>

				<h2>neuroethics</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>A repository of neuroethics readings and syllabi, appropriate for interested neuroscientists with little non-scientific training. I've scraped this together from previous neuroethics course syllabi and owe the lists to the fantastic instructors who compiled them. (Work in progress)</li>
					<li>The medical price list for all billable procedures at NYU Langone. NYU Langone was Cambridge Analytica's largest corporate client, and its trustees actively fund opposition to medicare for all.</li>
					<li>A panel discussion on neuroscience and socioeconomic inequality. </li>
					<li>A panel discussion on animal experimentation in neuroscience.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>philosophy of science/ mind</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>We run a for-fun, informal reading group for neuroscientists interested in reading philosophy of mind/ philosophy of science. We try to mostly cover topics related to neuroscience. Here is a repository of articles and books we've covered so far (work in progress). Please reach out if you're interested in joining (or coming to teach us one week)!</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>grad student empowerment</h2>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>A brief primer on some challenges faced by STEM graduate students. (Work in progress)</li>
					<li><a href= "https://makingabetternyu.org/">GSOC-UAW</a> (The Union for Graduate Employees at New York University). While NYU is one of the first private universities to have recognized its graduate student worker's union, STEM PhD students are specifically contractually excluded from this bargaining unit (with some teaching assistant-related exceptions). When will STEM students fight for unionization at private universities like NYU? </li> 
					<li><a href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/events/growingupinscience/">Growing Up in Science</a>: A speaker series in which STEM faculty members "share their life story, with a focus on struggles, failures, doubts, detours, and weaknesses." Started by my graduate advisor, Wei Ji Ma, it is now a worldwide network. An excellent antidote to imposter syndrome.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>favourite books</h2>
				<p>Here are some wide-ranging, general-audience books that I recommend to all my friends:
				<ul>
					<li>Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Wall Kimmerer (non-fiction)</li>
					<li>New Dark Age by James Bridle (non-fiction)</li>
					<li>Island by Aldous Huxley (fiction)</li>
					<li>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert Pirsig (fiction)</li>
				</ul>
